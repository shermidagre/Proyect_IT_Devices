**Device Name:**  
**Eco-Sync (Home Energy Reactivity Hub)**

**Group Members:**
1. [Alexandre]
2. [Jorge]
3. [Andrea]
4. [Samuel]

---

## 📐 Phase 1: Design & Specifications (Design Phase)
*Objective: Define a currently nonexistent device with clear technical specifications.*

### 1. General Concept
**Eco-Sync** is an intelligent energy management hub installed directly in the home’s electrical panel. Unlike current monitors that merely *observe*, Eco-Sync *acts*. It leverages Artificial Intelligence to micro-manage electricity flow—turning circuits on, off, or pausing them millisecond-by-millisecond—to capitalize on low-price energy windows and prevent appliance failures.

### 2. Technical Specifications

| Component            | Technical Detail                                     | Specific Function |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Central Processor** | **QAI-Core (Quantum AI Logic)**                      | Dedicated processor analyzing 50,000 data points per second (market prices, weather, user habits) with zero latency. |
| **Sensors**          | **Hall-Effect Nano-Sensors**                         | Installed at each circuit breaker. Measure each appliance’s electrical “signature” to identify which device is active and assess its health status. |
| **Actuators**        | **Solid-State Micro-Relays (SSR)**                  | Enable power cutoff or resumption in 0.01 seconds—silent and without mechanical wear. |
| **Connectivity**     | **6G + LPNM Mesh Network**                           | Direct connection to the global energy grid for real-time bidding, plus a low-power local mesh for communication with appliances. *(LPNM = Low-Power Neural Mesh)* |
| **Power Supply**     | **Graphene Backup Cells**                            | Internal 48-hour battery ensures continuous operation during citywide blackouts. |
| **Interface**        | **Wall-Projected Hologram**                          | No physical screen needed—projects real-time consumption data and alerts directly onto the electrical panel door. |

### 3. Key Features

* **⚡ Smart-Shifting:**  
  If your washing machine is about to heat water just as electricity prices spike, Eco-Sync pauses the cycle for 5 minutes—resuming only when rates drop—without user intervention.

* **🛠️ Tech-Doctor (Predictive Maintenance):**  
  Detects failure patterns.  
  *Example:*  
  _“Your air conditioner’s motor is using 15% more startup power than normal. Likely capacitor failure in ~2 weeks. 🛠️ Call technician?”_

* **⚖️ Grid-Balancing:**  
  Automatically sells surplus solar energy to the highest real-time bidder in the energy market.

## 📹 Phase 3: Video Recording
*Objective: Record final presentation for showcase on December 18.*

### Recording Checklist

1. **Set Design:**
    - [ ] Neutral background (plain white wall or clean whiteboard).
    - [ ] Good lighting (natural light or lamps—never backlit).

2. **Props:**
    - [ ] **The Device:** Small white/gray box with an LED or “Eco-Sync” logo sticker.
    - [ ] **The App:** One member holds a tablet/phone showing a static mockup with green graphs (battery/savings).

3. **Audio:**
    - [ ] Record in a quiet room.
    - [ ] Speak clearly and project toward the camera.

4. **Editing (Optional but Recommended):**
    - [ ] Add simple subtitles for technical terms (e.g., display “QAI-Core” on screen when mentioned).
    - [ ] Include a title card at the start with the project name.

### **DEMONSTRATION: Real-World Use Case**
*(Duration: ~90 sec)*

**PERSON 3 (The Demonstrator):**  
*[Holding phone/tablet simulating the app interface. Natural, conversational tone.]*

> _“Sounds complex, right? But for users, it’s magic. Let me show you how._
>
> _*[Looking at phone]* Imagine it’s 8 PM—peak hour; electricity is at its most expensive. I just plugged in my EV and started the washer, without thinking._
>
> _In a normal home, my bill would skyrocket. But watch what Eco-Sync does._
>
> _*[Show screen to camera]* The app alerts me: *‘Price peak detected.’* Automatically, Eco-Sync pauses the EV charge and delays the washer by 15 minutes._
>
> _I didn’t do anything. It waited for rates to drop—then resumed everything, seamlessly. Result? Maximum savings. Zero effort.”_
